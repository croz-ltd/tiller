> A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels.

**Tiller Design System** is open-source UI library which offers a set of visual, functional components and patterns that accelerate design and development. Components are endlessly customizable, accessible, and can integrate into any application with primarily focus on back-office applications. <br>
Tiller design system is based on **Tailwind UI/CS, Formik** and **ReachUI**. Besides these, Tiller is made with the help of **[Nx](https://nx.dev/), [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** and **[Codemod](https://github.com/facebookarchive/codemod)**.
