> A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels.

**Tiller Design System** is open-source UI library which offers a set of visual, functional components and patterns that accelerate design and development. Components are endlessly customizable, accessible, and can integrate into any application with primarily focus on back-office applications. <br>
Tiller design system is based on **Tailwind UI/CS, Formik** and **ReachUI**. Besides these, Tiller is made with the help of **Nx, Yarn 2, Storybook** and **Codemod**.

Tiller DS is bundled with a default theme that you can customize to match the look and feel of your project.

Customizations on theme level are implemented using design tokens which we call Tiller tokens.
For guides on Tiller tokens, head on over to our Storybook - [Theming and Customization](http://tiller-storybook-development.tos-cloud.lan.croz.net/?path=/story/theming-and-customization--page).
