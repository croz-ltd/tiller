# Login

The `Login` component has 8 possible variants - **`Simple, Basic, With Logo, With Validation, Forgotten Password, Email Confirmation, Reset Password and Success Password Change`**.

Login is often the first interaction a user has with your product. This entry point requires user identification,
regularly performed by entering user credentials. Login page has an important role in establishing your product’s brand
and experience and sets the tone for their overall experience with the product.

In order for the `Login` pattern to work you must wrap your `<App />` component within [IntlProvider](https://croz-ltd.github.io/tiller/?path=/docs/component-library-intl-intl--basic#intl-provider) and pass `patternsDictionary` as a `dictionary` prop.

```tsx
<IntlProvider lang={"en"} loadDictionary={undefined} dictionary={patternsDictionary}>
  <ThemeProvider themeConfig={defaultComponentConfig} iconConfig={defaultIconConfig}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
</IntlProvider>
```

## Basic Variant

The `Basic` variant has two `Input Fields`, `Checkbox` and `Button` all wrapped in one `Card` component.

Code sample of this variant:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="patterns-login--basic" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

The `Login` is presented to users in the following scenarios:

- When a user wants to gain access to an app.
- When a user has logged out voluntarily. They will see a confirmation message after which they will be automatically
  redirected back to the login page.
- When a user has been logged out due to inactivity. In this scenario, when the user logs back in they should be
  redirected to the last page they were on, before being logged out.

## Accessibility

Ensure that users can tab through the login form and navigate the page using only a keyboard.

Always provide fields with data areas for reading devices. This is especially important if you are using the
split-screen layout or have additional content on the page.

Make the contour of fields as bright as possible so that people with impaired vision can delineate inputs from the
background.

Never disable a submit button, even if all the required fields aren't filled in. Instead, describe what needs to be
done using validation and error messages.

## **Prerequisites for functioning**:

- Intl Provider (details [here](/docs/component-library-intl-intl--basic)) with imported patterns dictionary from
  `@tiller-ds/patterns` (if using multiple dictionaries you can merge them and hand them over to the provider)

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Best Practices

- Autofocus on a field that should be filled in. Therefore, it comes without saying that the first field should have
  an autofocus by default.
- Let users see their password if they want to.
- Tell users if Caps Lock is on.
- Make it easy if users forget their password.
- Give clear feedback & provide a helping hand in case users fail.
- Always add the “Forgot Password” link.
- Maintain branding and style on your sign-up and login pages.
- Test across browsers and devices.
