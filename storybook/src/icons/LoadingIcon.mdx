# Loading Icon

Use the `Loading Icon` component as a loader indicator in your projects when fetching data based on an animated SVG using the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

The `Loading Icon` component can be used as a loading indicator to improve the user experience whenever data is being fetched from your server.

Use a `Loading Icon` whenever the wait time is anticipated to be **longer** than **one second**.

Change the size of the icon component using the `size` prop.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Loading Icon Props:

<ArgsTable of={LoadingIcon} />
