# Badge

The `Badge` component is used to display data of your choice in a colored pill-shaped fashion.

It has 2 possible sizes - **basic and small**.

When the `small` prop is not explicitly stated, the component defaults to **basic** size.

## Best Practices

- Use the component to display short strings.
- If you want to display a certain attribute of the object, choose the most important one or one that suits the context of what you are trying to convey.

The best example of Badge usage is displayed in the [tags variant of the Autocomplete Field component](/docs/component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-tags).

All props are described in detail on the [Badge Props section](#badge-props)
of the documentation.

## Badge Factory

The `Badge Factory` story is used to easily create a Badge, giving you the
ability to modify most of the props and make the Badge of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Badge: <br />

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Badge Factory` story
of the Badge.
- Modify props using controls. **Note:** `Container ClassName` represents arbitrary additional classes injected into the component's class name (ex. hover effects, etc.).
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Badge.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Badge, the code of the Badge will be generated.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-badge--badge-factory" />
</Canvas>

<Stories />

## Badge Props:

<ArgsTable of={Badge} />
