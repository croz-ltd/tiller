# Button Groups

The `Button Groups` component is used to display multiple buttons grouped together.

The component uses the `Button` component internally, hence the `ButtonGroups.Button` subcomponent inherits all the props from the `Button` component
for easy customization of the overall look of the grouped buttons.

See the stories' code for best showcase on how to use this component.

All props are described in detail on the [Button Groups Props](#button-groups-props) section of the documentation.

## Best Practices

- Use the component for previous and next buttons often found on websites (see [Icon Only story](#with-icon)).
- Use the component for toggles between - for example - changing the display of the calendar (see [Basic story](#basic)).
- Avoid using the component for pagination since Tiller Design System already has the Pagination component which uses Button Groups to display navigation for
your displayed items (see [Pagination](/docs/component-library-core-pagination--simple))

## Button Groups Factory

The `Button Groups Factory` story is used to easily create a Button Groups component, giving you the
ability to modify most of the props and make the component of your choice by
using `Controls`.

**Limitations:**
 - You can only pass text values as button content (see [IconOnly](#icon-only) and [WithIcon](#with-icon) stories to see how to add icons additionally).

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-buttongroups--button-groups-factory" />
</Canvas>
