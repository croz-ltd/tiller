# Link

The `Link` component is used to redirect the user to a specific destination url.

By using the `to` prop (**component must be wrapped inside a router**), you can specify the destination url where you'll be transferred to when you
click the link.

The `variant` prop specifies the look of the link. The default selected variant is **main**, which selects `linkColor` from your
default config's `color` configuration (located in your _tillerConfig_ file).

The out-of-the-box configuration for link color is:

```ts
linkColor: {
  main: "blue-800",
  hover: "blue-600",
},
```

All props are described in detail on the [Link Props](#link-props) section of the documentation.
