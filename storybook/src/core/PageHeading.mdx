# Page Heading

The `PageHeading` component is used to display a descriptive heading with or without subtitles, actions and breadcrumbs on your page.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-pageheading--with-subtitle-and-actions" />
</Canvas>


You can customize the `PageHeading` component in the [Page Heading Factory](#page-heading-factory).

## Usage

There are various page heading appearances you can achieve by using this component.

You can:
 - Define your title with `PageHeading.Title` (not exclusively text).
 - Define your subtitle with `PageHeading.Subtitle` (not exclusively text).
 - Define your actions with `PageHeading.Actions` and pass your desired actions (most commonly Buttons) to the subcomponent.
The component itself will automatically display the actions on the right (or under the title on mobile displays).
See [this story](#with-subtitle-and-actions) for best example of this usage.
-  Define your breadcrumbs with `PageHeading.Breadcrumbs`, which will render above the title (see [Breadcrumbs documentation](/docs/component-library-core-breadcrumbs--simple#breadcrumbs) if you are unfamiliar with this component).
Since this essentially represents the `Breadcrumbs` component, you can pass all of its props here (see [Breadcrumbs props](/docs/component-library-core-breadcrumbs--simple#breadcrumbs-props)).
Inside `PageHeading.Breadcrumbs` define `PageHeading.Breadcrumb` elements with desired content inside (not exclusively text).
See [this story](#with-breadcrumbs) for best example of this usage.
- Define your meta text with `PageHeading.Meta`. This will render your desired meta content underneath the title and subtitle.
See [this story](#with-meta) for best example of this usage.

## Page Heading Factory

The `Page Heading Factory` story is used to easily create a Page Heading, giving you the
ability to modify most of the props and make the Page Heading of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Page Heading: <br />

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Page Heading Factory` story
of the Page Heading.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Page Heading.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Page Heading, the code of the Page Heading will be generated.
