# Progress Bar

The `ProgressBar` component is used to display the completion of an arbitrary process in a form of a stepper with steps.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-progress-bar--simple" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

It is recommended to nest the `ProgressBar` component inside the `Card` component for optimal appearance.

When defining the progress bar, you can:
 - define it as completed or change the starting index via props.
 - define steps with `ProgressBar.Step` and mark them as active or inactive.

All props are described in detail on the [Progress Bar Props](#progress-bar-props) section of the documentation.

## Accessibility

- The component is optimized for mobile usage and changes the look when on mobile from a row display to a column display.
- The component has a horizontal scroll if all steps can't fit inside the container.
