# Container

The `Container` component is used to contain the content of your website in order to avoid stretching your content
to the edges, which is an undesired behaviour on websites.

The component has a couple of variants to choose from, with each being unique in its behaviour according to the screen size:
 - **Max** (default) - provides padding when width is 640px or greater and has a maximum width of 1536px.
 - **Constrained Padded** - always provides padding and has a maximum width of 1280px.
 - **Narrow Constrained** - provides an outer container which always provides padding along with the inner container with a maximum width 768px.
 - **Full Width** - provides padding when width is 640px or greater and has a maximum width of 1280px.
 - **Full Width Container** - uses TailwindCSS's [_container_ class](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container) and always provides padding.

For detailed information about classes used in each variant, jump ahead to [Container tokens](#container-tokens).

## Best Practices

- Use the 'narrow constrained' variant if your page doesn't contain too much information in order to accentuate and draw focus to your content and avoid too much blank space.
- Use variants which include padding on all screen sizes if your website is most often used on mobile devices.
- Use 'full width' or 'max' variants if your website is most often used on desktop devices.

All props are described in detail on the [Container Props section](#container-props)
of the documentation.
