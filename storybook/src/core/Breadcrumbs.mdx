# Breadcrumbs

The `Breadcrumbs` component is used to display navigation on your site in order to easily orient the user.

It has 4 different variants:
 - None
 - Solid
 - Slash
 - Chevron
 - Big Chevron

All props are described in detail on the [Breadcrumbs Props](#breadcrumbs-props) section of the documentation.

## Breadcrumbs Factory

The `Breadcrumbs Factory` story is used to easily visualize your breadcrumbs, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Breadcrumbs of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Breadcrumbs:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Breadcrumbs Factory` story
of the Breadcrumbs.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Breadcrumbs.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Breadcrumbs, the code of the Breadcrumbs will be generated.

**Limitations:**
  - Due to Storybook's limitations, the shown code will not be functional **unless you replace the following**:
      - `Breadcrumb` -> `Breadcrumbs.Breadcrumb`

  <Story id="component-library-core-breadcrumbs--breadcrumbs-factory" />
