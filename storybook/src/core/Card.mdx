# Card

The `Card` component is the most contained and organized way to show your data on a screen. It is widely used
on web pages because it makes you focus on the content inside and basically serves as a container for your content.

The component can be displayed with or without `Header` and `Footer`.

All props are described in detail on the [Card Props](#card-props) section of the documentation.

You can customize the `Card` component in the [Card Factory](#card-factory-limited).

## Basic Variant

The `Basic` variant gives a visual foundation for your components.

Code sample of this variant:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-card--basic" />
</Canvas>

## With Header

The `With Header` variant represents a card with the header on top, which can be further customized.

More info on different variations of the header is on the [Card Header](#card-header) section of the documentation.

Code sample of this variant:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-card--with-header" />
</Canvas>

## With Footer

The `With Footer` variant represents a card with the footer on the bottom, which can be further customized.

More info on different variations of the footer is on the [Card Footer](#card-footer) section of the documentation.

Code sample of this variant:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-card--with-footer" />
</Canvas>

## With Header and Footer

The `With Header and Footer` variant represents a card with both the header on top and a footer on the bottom.

Code sample of this variant:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-card--with-header-and-footer" />
</Canvas>

## Loading

The `Loading` variant represents a card in the state of loading, suitable for putting the Card in this state
whenever, for example, the data represented in the card is still fetching from the backend.

This state can easily be triggered by passing a **`status`** prop to the Card and giving it a value of *`waiting`*

Code sample of this variant:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-card--loading" />
</Canvas>

### Card Header

`Card Header` is versatile and allows you to customize it to your desires.

However, there are a few common versions of the header - `Default` and `With Actions` - each optionally
given an expander when initializing the `Card` component with: `<Card isExpanded={true}>`.

<div className="space-y-4">
  <Card>
    <Card.Header type="default">
      <Card.Header.Title>Title</Card.Header.Title>
      <Card.Header.Subtitle>Subtitle</Card.Header.Subtitle>
    </Card.Header>
  </Card>
  <Card isExpanded={true}>
    <Card.Header type="expander">
      <Card.Header.Title>Title</Card.Header.Title>
      <Card.Header.Subtitle>Subtitle</Card.Header.Subtitle>
    </Card.Header>
  </Card>
  <Card isExpanded={true}>
    <Card.Header type="button">
      <Card.Header.Title>Title</Card.Header.Title>
      <Card.Header.Subtitle>Subtitle</Card.Header.Subtitle>
      <Card.Header.Actions>
        <Button>Button</Button>
        <Button>Button</Button>
      </Card.Header.Actions>
    </Card.Header>
  </Card>
</div>

### Card Body

`Card Body` is where you place your desired content. Anywhere from `Description Lists`, `Data Tables` and so on.

You can pass a custom `className` to the body or enable `removeSpacing` prop to remove the default padding.

### Card Footer

`Card Footer` is versatile and allows you to customize it to your desires.

However, there are a few common versions of the header - `With Actions` and `Pagination`.

<IntlProvider>
  <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
    <Card isExpanded={true}>
      <Card.Footer>
        <div className="flex justify-end">
          <Button className="mr-3" variant="outlined" type="reset" onClick={() => {}}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
        </div>
      </Card.Footer>
    </Card>
    <Card isExpanded={true}>
      <Card.Footer>
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <PageResizer pageSize={10} pageSizes={[10, 20, 30]} totalElements={50} onPageSizeChange={() => {}} />
          <Pagination onPageChange={() => {}} pageNumber={6} pageSize={10} totalElements={150} />
        </div>
      </Card.Footer>
    </Card>
  </div>
</IntlProvider>

<br />

## Card Factory

In `Card Factory`, you can choose whether you want the Card with the header, footer, both or none.

Also, you can customize the `Title`, `Subtitle`, `Header Type` and `Footer Type`.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-card--card-factory" />
</Canvas>

## Card Props:

<ArgsTable of={Card} />

## Card Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="Card"/>
