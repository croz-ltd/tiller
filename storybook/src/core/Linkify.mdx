# Linkify

The `Linkify` component is used to detect links among text handed over as children to the component.

It uses the `LinkifyLibrary` component **react-linkify** library to deal with the logic of parsing the text and detecting links.

Links can range from links without defined protocol, e-mails, etc. and are **automatically** turned into clickable colored links.

The `variant` prop specifies the look of the found link(s). The default selected variant is **main**, which selects `linkColor` from your
default config's `color` configuration (located in your _tillerConfig_ file).

The out-of-the-box configuration for link color is:

```ts
linkColor: {
  main: "blue-800",
  hover: "blue-600",
},
```

All props are described in detail on the [Linkify Props](#linkify-props) section of the documentation.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Linkify Props:

<ArgsTable of={Linkify} include={["children", "variant", "tokens"]} />

**Linkify library-specific props** are described in detail on the [Linkify Documentation page](https://linkify.js.org/docs/options.html).
