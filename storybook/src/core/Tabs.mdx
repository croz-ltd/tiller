# Tabs

The `Tabs` component is used to display tabs for quick and easy navigation through arbitrary pages on your website.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-core-tabs--simple" />
</Canvas>

The component can be stacked or displayed in its full-width via `fullWidth` prop (see [this story](#full-width)).

You can also define the icon placement to be before or after the label via `iconPlacement` prop
(see the [leading icons](#with-leading-icons) or [trailing icons](#with-trailing-icons) stories).

Furthermore, the `defaultIndex` prop allows you to specify which tab is the default one on component render.
If you wish to have more control over your Tabs you can use `index` prop to set currently selected tab,
note that if you use `index` prop you also need to handle index changes so prop `onTabChange` must also be present

## Usage

The component is recommended to be used as following:
 - define the component with or without above-mentioned props.
 - define the `Tabs.Tab` subcomponent with a required `label` prop, as well as optional `icon` and `onClick` props.
 - place the desired content inside the `Tabs.Tab` subcomponent to render it when that tab is active.

All props are described in detail on the [Tabs Props](#tabs-props) section of the documentation.

## Tabs Factory

The `Tabs Factory` story is used to easily visualize your tabs, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Tabs component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Tabs component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Tabs Factory` story
of the Tabs.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Tabs.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Tabs, the code of the Tabs will be generated.
