# Description List

Description lists are a way to organize and explain related information. They’re particularly useful when you need to list and define terms such as in a glossary.

The `<dl>` HTML element represents a **description list**. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the `<dt>` element) and descriptions (provided by `<dd>` elements).

Common uses for this element are to implement a `glossary` or to `display metadata` (a list of key-value pairs).

Use when you need to present merchants with a list of items or terms alongside descriptions and explanations.

## Description List Factory

The `Description List Factory` story is used to easily visualize your description lists, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Description List component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Description List component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Description List Factory` story
of the Description List.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Description List.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Description List, the code of the Description List will be generated.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-data-display-descriptionlist--description-list-factory" />
</Canvas>

<Stories />

## Best Practices:
Description lists should:

- Contain terms and associated explanations, or descriptions for each term.
- Provide information that isn’t action-oriented.
- Not be an excuse for using unnecessarily complicated or jargon-filled language.

## Description List Props:

<ArgsTable of={DescriptionList} />

## Description List Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="DescriptionList"/>
