# Data Table

`Data Tables` are used to organize and display all information from a data set.

Data Tables display information in a way that's easy to scan, so that users can look for patterns and insights. They can be embedded in primary content, such as cards. They can include:

- A corresponding visualization
- Navigation
- Tools to query and manipulate data

Here's an example of the `allData` object used in Stories shown below.

```ts
type Item = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  surname: string;
  appliedFor: string;
  jobDescription: string;
  salary: {
    annual: number;
    bonus: number;
  };
};

const names = ["Pero", "Ivo", "Ana", "Ivica"];
const surname = ["Peric", "Ivic", "Anic", "Ivicici"];
const jobs = ["Nurse", "Teacher", "Software developer", "Lawyer"];
const jobDescription = [
  "You will be tasked with caring for pediatric patients with a variety of health conditions and challenges as well as collaborating with physicians to provide the highest-quality care possible to each individual. As a registered nurse on staff, you will communicate orders to medical assistants and other team members and coordinate with staff and families to ensure the adherence to the attending physician’s instructions as well as proper care and disease control practices.",
  "The teaching profession is exciting and challenging. Teachers act as role models, mentors, caregivers and advisers. They can have a profound effect on the lives of their students.",
  "The job of a software developer depends on the needs of the company, organization or team they are on. Some build and maintain systems that run devices and networks. Others develop applications that make it possible for people to perform specific tasks on computers, cellphones or other devices.",
  "A lawyer provides counsel and represents businesses, individuals, and government agencies in legal matters and disputes. A lawyer'ss main duties are to uphold the law while protecting a client's rights. Lawyers advise, research, and collect evidence or information, draft legal documents such as contracts, divorces, or real estate transactions, and defend or prosecute in court",
];
const allData: Item[] = range(0, 152).map((value) => ({
  id: value + 1,
  name: names[value % names.length],
  surname: surname[value % surname.length],
  age: (12 + value * 13) % 50,
  appliedFor: jobs[value % jobs.length],
  jobDescription: jobDescription[value % jobs.length],
  salary: {
    annual: (value + 5) * 12000,
    bonus: (value + 5) * 200,
  },
}));
```

You can get `smallData` object used in Stories below by slicing `allData` object:
```ts
const smallData = slice(allData, 0, 5);
```

## Custom Sorting in DataTable

The `DataTable` component in `@tiller-ds` provides the flexibility to implement custom sorting for columns. <br/>
The `useDataTable` hook is responsible for managing the state related to the DataTable, including the sorting information.<br/>
The `useEffect` inside DataTable propagates internal sorting changes `(state.sortBy)` to the external world through the provided hook.

This separation of concerns enables independent management of internal sorting state and ensures synchronization between internal and external representations. This design choice makes the DataTable component more flexible and adaptable to different use cases.

To enable custom sorting, follow these steps:

**1.** Ensure that the column for which you want to implement sorting has the `canSort` prop set to `true`:
```tsx
<DataTable.Column header="Name" accessor="name" canSort={true} />
```

**2.** Implement your custom sorting logic. You can use the `useEffect` hook to listen for changes in the sort state and trigger the sorting logic accordingly.
Here is an example utilizing the `useMemo` hook. This specific logic is applied in the [With Default Ascending Sort By Name story](https://croz-ltd.github.io/tiller/?path=/story/component-library-data-display-datatable--with-default-ascending-sort-by-name).
```ts
  const [dataTableState, dataTableHook] = useDataTable({
    defaultSortBy: [
      {
        column: "name",
        sortDirection: "ASCENDING",
      },
    ],
  });

  const sortedData = React.useMemo(() => {
    return [...smallData].sort((a, b) => {
      const sortInfo = dataTableState.sortBy[0] ?? { column: "", sortDirection: "ASCENDING" };

      if (a[sortInfo.column] !== undefined && b[sortInfo.column] !== undefined) {
        const result = a[sortInfo.column].localeCompare(b[sortInfo.column]);
        return sortInfo.sortDirection === "DESCENDING" ? -result : result;
      }

      return 0;
    });
  }, [dataTableState.sortBy]);
```

**3.** To set a default sorting behavior, use the `defaultSortBy` prop in the DataTable component. The `defaultSortBy` prop is an array of SortInfo objects, specifying the initial sorting configuration for the DataTable.
```tsx
<DataTable data={sortedData} hook={dataTableHook} defaultSortBy={dataTableState.sortBy}>
```

Now you have a DataTable component with sorting enabled for the specified column, and you can implement your own sorting logic based on your application requirements.

### useSortableDataTable hook
The `@tiller-ds/data-display` package provides a datatable sorting hook that allows you to implement custom sorting logic for your table columns. Here's an example of using the sorting hook in a DataTable:
```tsx
import { DataTable, useSortableDataTable } from '@tiller-ds/data-display';

// Define column mapping for custom sorting
const columnMapping = {
  name: 'name',
  surname: "surname",
};

const { dataTableHook, sortedData } = useSortableDataTable(allData || [], columnMapping);

<DataTable
  data={sortedData}
  hook={dataTableHook}
  defaultSortBy={[
    {
      column: 'name',
      sortDirection: 'ASCENDING',
    },
    {
      column: "surname",
      sortDirection: "ASCENDING",
    },
  ]}
>
  <DataTable.Column header="ID" accessor="id" canSort={false} />
  <DataTable.Column header="Name" accessor="name" canSort={true} />
  <DataTable.Column header="Surname" accessor="surname" canSort={true} />
</DataTable>;
```

The sorting hook, `useSortableDataTable`, enhances the DataTable component by providing a mechanism for sorting logic.
It takes the table data and a column mapping as input and returns the necessary hook and sorted data.
The column mapping is an object where keys represent column names and values represent their corresponding data keys.

The hook returns an object with two properties:
- `dataTableHook`: the hook that should be passed to the `hook` prop of the DataTable component
- `sortedData`: the data array that has been sorted

Ensure that the `canSort` prop is set to `true` for columns that should be sortable. <br/>
Default sorting behavior can be configured using the `defaultSortBy` prop on the DataTable component. <br/>
You can use this hook to implement sorting for specific columns according to your requirements.

## Best Practices

Data Tables should:

- Show values across multiple categories and measures.
- Allow for filtering and ordering when comparison is not a priority.
- Help visualize and scan many values from an entire data set.
- Help find other values in the data hierarchy through use of links.
- Minimize clutter by only including values that supports the data’s purpose.
- Wrap instead of truncate content. This is because if row titles start with the same word, they’ll all appear the same when truncated.


## DataTable with Selectors

In case you want select rows in the DataTable, you must provide `hook={dataTableHook}` prop.

The `hook` manages selection of items in the data table, sorting, etc.

Import `useDataTable` hook also from `@tiller-ds/data-display`.

### Selectors at Beginning

### Selectors at End

## DataTable with Horizontal Scroll

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-data-display-datatable--with-horizontal-scroll" />

Use `firstColumnFixed` prop to make first column **sticky** in DataTable. Use `lastColumnFixed` for the last column.

## Data Table Factory

The `Data Table Factory` story is used to easily create a Data Table, giving you the
ability to modify most of the props and make the Data Table of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Data Table: <br />

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Data Table Factory` story
of the Badge.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Data Table.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Data Table, the code of the Data Table will be generated.

### Result:
