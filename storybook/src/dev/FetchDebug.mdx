# Fetch Debug

This component represents a tool used to **debug and simulate fetch requests**.

You can pause the requests, change the latency and track the progress of fetch requests.

The requests are categorized into waiting, active and history groups.

The tool is intended for developers to use when testing the application. **It is not intended to be used in production.**

## Usage

 - Render the component in the root of your application (most commonly App.tsx)

 - To show the Fetch Debug display, use the following key combination: **`Ctrl + Shift + F`**

 - Modify the settings using the checkbox for pause and the slider for latency

 - Track the requests in the waiting, active and history groups
