# Lag Radar

This component represents a tool that can be used to **measure the performance** of your website.

By executing various actions on your website, the component will measure the time it takes for the browser to respond to these actions
(page load).

The results are displayed in a form of colors on the radar. The green represents low page load, while all the
colors towards red represent an increased page load.

The tool is intended for developers to use when testing the application. **It is not intended to be used in production.**

## Usage

 - Render the component in the root of your application (most commonly App.tsx)

 - To show the Lag Radar display, use the following key combination: **`Ctrl + Shift + L`**

 - Track the page load using the radar display

The look of Lag Radar is displayed below:

<img className="w-96" src={lagRadar} alt="Lag Radar" />
