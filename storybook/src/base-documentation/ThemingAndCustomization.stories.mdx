# Theming and customization

Customizations on theme level are implemented using design tokens which we call **Tiller tokens**.

Tiller tokens allow us to customize the general look and feel of the Tiller design system. Changing a token results in changing the look and feel of all the components that use that specific token.

## How tokens work

Behind the scenes Tiller uses Tailwind CSS to style all the components. Every component uses the default Tiller theme which has different tokens set for all the components.

Tokens are seperated in three different categories:

1. **Global tokens** - default tailwind color palettes, spacing settings and other (eg. `blue-400` = `#60a5fa`). Used to define possible values for other layers.
2. **Decision tokens** - custom theme overrides, mostly for colors and text configurations (eg. `primary-400` = `blue-400`, `secondary` = `yellow-600`). Used to define global configuration for most of the design system.
3. **Component specific tokens** - custom component configurations (eg. `Button.primary.backgroundColor` = `primary-400`). Used to fine tune specific components.

## Global tokens

Options tokens are all available values that you can use to set a certain decision token of a component. They are customized in `tailwind.config.js` file.

Since Tiller uses Tailwind CSS behind the scenes, option tokens are mostly Tailwind class names which are defined by tailwind default configuration and `tailwind.config.js` file in your project (which customizes the default Tailwind configuration).

Since any edit to the tailwind configuration file changes how tailwind classes behave - changing the tailwind configuration file is considered as a change to the options tokens.

Examples of options tokens:

- `text-sm` class
- `text-purple-400` class
- `purple-200` color
- `pl-2` class

More on customizing tailwind configuration in their official [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration)

## Decision tokens

Decision tokens define the look and feel of Tiller apps. Decision tokens use options tokens as values.

They are also defined inside `tailwind.config.js` file as custom aliases for colors.

### Structure of theme decision tokens

Under the hood they look something like this:

```json
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      // brand
      primary: {
        ...colors.indigo,
        DEFAULT: colors.indigo["600"],
        light: colors.indigo["100"],
        dark: colors.indigo["800"],
        contrast: colors.white
      },
      ...
      // status
      info: {
        ...colors.blue,
        DEFAULT: colors.blue["600"],
        light: colors.blue["100"],
        dark: colors.blue["900"],
        contrast: colors.white
      }
    },
  },
}
```

For full list you can check `preset.ts`, which you should be using inside your tailwind config.

As you can see, all the tokens utilize tailwinds default color palette or default theme.
You can also override that with your fixed hex values, or override global token layer for them to be usable for aliases.
There are also utility methods in `@tiller-ds/theme` called `color` and `font` which enable you to shorthand define a whole color / font config.

Here is an example of a `tailwind.config.js` which overrides the default color used in the application.

```js
const { preset, color } = require('@tiller-ds/theme');

module.exports = {
  presets: [preset],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // brand
        primary: color("blue", {
          dark: "900",
          light: "300",
          default: "500",
          contrast: "white",
        }),
        secondary: color("yellow"),
        tertiary: color("teal"),
        // status
        success: color("green", { dark: "900" }),
        danger: color("red", { dark: "900" }),
        warning: color("orange", { dark: "900" }),
        info: color("blue", { dark: "900" }),
      },
    }
  }
};
```

*Note: if you override `content` or `safelist` attributes, please pay attention that those are not merged with Tiller's preset so additional configuration may be needed.*

## Customizing individual components

Besides customization of decision tokens of the theme, you can customize classes used on individual components.
By changing individual components you can override specific attributes which you need, while preserving everything else from default theme.

To customize component classes edit the `component` property of your component config object inside `tiller.config.ts` file.

Each component has its own properties which apply certain tailwind classes to the component.

Component tokens are listed in the `Docs` section of each component.

Example:

```ts
import { ThemeConfigFactory } from "@tiller-ds/theme";

export const defaultComponentConfig: ThemeConfigFactory = {
  component: {
    Button: {
      base: {
        borderRadius: "rounded",
      },
    },
    Badge: {
      base: {
        padding: "", // remove padding by canceling out default padding classes
        lineHeight: "leading-5",
      },
      small: {
        padding: "px-2.5",
        lineHeight: "leading-4",
      },
    },
  },
};
```
and add this to your `ThemeProvider`.

## One-off component customizations

You may find yourself in a situation where your global theme configuration is serving you well, but you really need that one button
to be a bit different from everything else.

One-off customizations can help you with that exact problem.

Every Tiller component has a `tokens` prop that can be used to send custom token list different from one used in your theme configuration.

A quick of example of the idea:

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@tiller-ds/core";

const roundedButtonTokens = {
  base: {
    borderRadius: "rounded"
  }
};

const RoundedButton = ({ props }: ButtonProps) => <Button {...props} tokens={roundedButtonTokens}/>
export default RoundedButton;
```

Tokens used this way are deeply merged with your theme configuration, so you can override only the attributes you need.
