# Introduction

<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 w-full justify-center items-center">
    <img className="w-full shadow-md" src={cover} alt="Tiller Cover Image" />
    <span className="text-xl text-center">Welcome to Tiller Design System - an open-source UI library which offers a set of visual, functional components and patterns
    that accelerate design and development.</span>
</div>

<hr  className="my-2"/>

### Inspiration

Tiller is based on **Tailwind CSS, Formik and ReachUI** and is a collection of **React** components that can
be used to build a website or an application.

### Source Code

The system is **heavily typified**, which means that you can use it in a TypeScript project without any problems.
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/croz-ltd/tiller).

## Why Tiller?

What sets this system apart from other design systems is that it focuses on the best possible developer experience by providing
fast prototyping via Storybook and heavily documented props, so you can get by even if you don't wish to use Storybook as a tool.

The tools we use to speed up development and increase productivity are:
 - **React** - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 - **Typescript** - a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript and provides autocompletion.
 - **Tailwind CSS** - a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
 - **Formik** - a library for building forms in React, without the tears
    (see our [Formik-elements](/story/component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--autocomplete-field-factory) components).
 - **Figma** - a prototyping tool which is mainly used for designing and documenting our components (see our **Figma UI kit [here](https://www.figma.com/file/QVaavJ0ZFn1AOsBnTjr7F1/Tiller-Design-System---UI-KIT?node-id=8627%3A11169&t=F3NI5LM7tIG1qSnq-0)**).
 - **Storybook** - a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.
 - **Storybook Docs** - a tool for documenting components in Storybook.
 - **Storybook Addon Controls** - a tool for controlling props dynamically in Storybook, in our case used for [Factory](/docs/introduction--page#factories) stories.
 - **Storybook Addon Playroom** - a tool for prototyping and experimenting with components in isolation.
 - **Storybook Addon Designs** - a tool for viewing Figma designs in Storybook.

Since we are using Tailwind CSS natively, using it is **recommended** for styling your components and for the best possible experience,
but you can also pass your own CSS classes if you don't prefer Tailwind CSS. The only downside of this approach is limited
customization of the components in Storybook, since factories - explained [here](/docs/introduction--page#factories) -
can only parse Tailwind CSS classes.

### Installing

For detailed instructions on how to install the system and import the components,
please refer to the [Installation](/docs/installation-and-importing--page) section.

### Theming

One of the main features of Tiller is the ability to **customize the system to your needs** by modifying your defined
colors configuration through the `tailwind.config.js` file and components configuration through our `tiller.config.ts` file.

For detailed instructions on how to customize the system, please refer
to the [Theming and customization](/docs/theming-and-customization--page) section.


# ðŸš€ From Storybook to Code

In the following chapters you will get acquainted with the fast process of transforming your components from
viewing them inside Storybook to their code equivalent.

We'll cover the following topics in the next chapters:
 - [Interface](/docs/introduction--page#interface)
 - [Factories](/docs/introduction--page#factories)
 - [Playroom](/docs/introduction--page#playroom)

## Interface

Storybook provides a very simple and intuitive interface, which is divided into three main parts:
 - **Components overview** - where you can see all the components in the design system.
 - **Canvas** and **Docs** - where you can see the component, its documentation.
 - **Controls** and **Design** - where you can see the props' documentation and the design of the component.

The video below demonstrates how to easily view the story, its design and code - which you can easily copy and
transfer into the Playroom or the project you're working on.

<video src={tutorial_interface}
       controls={false}
       autoPlay={true}
       muted={true}
       loop={true}
       title="Interface Showcase" />

## Factories

Some components have **Factory** stories, which are stories that are generated dynamically based on the props you
change via the **Controls** tab. This is a very useful feature, since it allows you to quickly see how the component
looks with different props.

The best way to see all the available factories is to search for the `Factory` keyword in the Storybook's search bar.

All factories also have support for **tokens**, which are explained in the [Theming and customization](/story/theming-and-customization--page) section.
Tokens are filtered to only include changed ones in the code output when you change them via factories.

The demo video below demonstrates how to use the [Description List Factory](/story/component-library-data-display-descriptionlist--description-list-factory)
to create your `Description List` template, which can be simply copied and pasted into the Playroom or the project
you're working on by going to the **Docs** section once you're finished and clicking on **Show Code** button underneath the story.

<video src={tutorial_factories}
       controls={false}
       autoPlay={true}
       muted={true}
       loop={true}
       title="Factories Showcase" />

## Playroom

**Playroom** is a tool for prototyping and experimenting with components in isolation
and makes building UIs organized and efficient. It's available next to the Canvas and Docs sections, and you can use it to quickly transition from your
view of the component to the code playground.

If you want to access Playroom **separate from Storybook**,
head on over to the isolated [Playroom](https://croz-ltd.github.io/tiller/playroom) page.

Similar to Figma, you can prototype your components but **can't pass any logic to them**, so it's a great tool
for visualizing your components before you put your custom logic on top in your project.

There are different approaches you can take with this tool:
 - **Copy and paste** - you can copy the code from the **Docs** section of the component you want to prototype.
 - **Use factories** - you can use the factories to create your component and then copy the code from the **Docs** section.
 - **Use preset snippets** - by clicking on the plus button on the bottom toolbar you can add an arbitrary snippet from the
                            list of defined snippets.

The demo video below demonstrates how you can quickly generate your website template using our predefined snippets.

<video src={tutorial_playroom}
       controls={false}
       autoPlay={true}
       muted={true}
       loop={true}
       title="Playroom Showcase" />
