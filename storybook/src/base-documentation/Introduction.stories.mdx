## How to import component

Component Library is divided into `modules`. Each folder represents one module.

To import a component, the corresponding module needs to be installed first. One way to install the module is to enter the name of the module in the `package.json` file in format `"@tiller-ds/core": "0.0.0-dev"` and run `yarn install`.

In case you are using `tiller-starter template`, `@tiller-ds/core` module will be installed by default.

## Storybook Design Tab

If you are new to Storybook, you may have a problem with `WebGL` when viewing the **Design** tab in Storybook.

Fortunately, there is a very simple solution.

#### **Chrome**

WebGL should be enabled in recent versions of Chrome. If you aren’t able to run WebGL in Chrome, make sure that you update to the most recent version of Chrome.

If you are using the most recent version of Chrome and can’t access WebGL content, make sure that hardware acceleration is enabled in your Chrome settings.

1. Go to **chrome://settings** in your address bar, or click the **Chrome menu** in the upper-right corner of your browser window and select **Settings**.
2. Use the search bar to locate the hardware acceleration setting, or scroll to the bottom of the Settings page, click **Advanced** and look in the **System** section.
3. Toggle **Use hardware acceleration when available** to **on** (the toggle is blue when hardware acceleration is on, and white when hardware acceleration is off).

In case option iz already set to **on**, **reset** it, and relaunch Chrome.
