# Checkbox

Checkboxes allow the user to select one or more items from a set. Checkboxes can turn an option on or off.

You can provide a label to the Checkbox thanks to the `label` prop.

You can control the checkbox with the `checked` and `onChange` props.

## When to use:

- In forms on a full page, in modals, or on side panels
- Select one or more options from a list
- Present a list containing sub-selections
- Turn an item on or off in a desktop environment

## When not to use:

If a user can select only one option from a list, radio buttons should be used instead of checkboxes.

Checkboxes allow the user to select multiple items in a set whereas radio buttons allow the user to select only one option.

(for integration with Formik see docs [here](/docs/component-library-formik-elements-checkboxfield--simple))

## Checkbox Factory

The `Checkbox Factory` story is used to easily visualize your checkbox, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Checkbox component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Checkbox component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Checkbox Factory` story
of the Checkbox.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Checkbox.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Checkbox, the code of the Checkbox will be generated.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-form-elements-checkbox--checkbox-factory" />
</Canvas>


<Stories />

## Checkbox Props:

<ArgsTable of={Checkbox} />

## Checkbox Tokens:
