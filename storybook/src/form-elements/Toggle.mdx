# Toggle

`Toggle` is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states.

Toggles are only used for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips the switch”.

They are commonly used for “on/off” switches.

Use `labels` with a toggle so the action is clear. Labels should be three words or less and appear on the side of a toggle.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Toggle Props:

<ArgsTable of={Toggle} />

## Toggle Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="Toggle"/>
