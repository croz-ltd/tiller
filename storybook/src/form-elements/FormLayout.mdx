# Form Layout

The `FormLayout` component makes creating forms easier by providing you with a focused display for your form which
can be divided into sections with desired content and actions.

The component has a couple of types to choose from, with each being unique in its visual representation of the component:

- **Simple** (default) - provides a layout that supports sections.
- **Card** - provides a layout with titles and/or subtitles on the left side and section's content on the right side with **only** section's content wrapped in a Card component.
- **Full Width** - provides a layout with titles and/or subtitles on the left side and section's content on the right side, **both** wrapped in a Card component.

**NOTE**: `FormLayout` gives you a template for making forms, you still need to wrap the component in Formik or other form-handling libraries.

## Usage

**1)** Define your form layout with `FormLayout` (optionally choose a type with `type` prop).

**2)** Define your sections with `FormLayout.Section` with optional title and subtitle props.

**3)** Define your section's content with `FormLayout.Section.Content` and optionally remove the spacing with `removeSpacing` prop.
Place your desired field components inside this element. If you wish to have the title and/or subtitle separated from the form fields you can do so
by defining `FormLayout.Field` with the name **equal to the field element** you wish to place inside the `FormLayout.Field` (see [Separate Labels story](#separate-labels)).

**4)** Define your section's actions with `FormLayout.Section.Actions`. The component automatically separates elements defined here after the content.

If you wish to **change the background** of the Form Layout components, you can do so using tokens (see [Form Layout Tokens](#form-layout-tokens)).

## Best Practices

- Use sections as intended, with each being about certain specific attributes to keep the user focused.
- Do not overpopulate the sections and avoid creating them without a proper title and/or subtitle to keep the user informed about the context (unless the context is clearly defined somewhere else).

All props are described in detail on the [Form Layout Props section](#form-layout-props)
of the documentation.
