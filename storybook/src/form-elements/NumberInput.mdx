# Number Input

A `NumberInput` supports many of the same features as `Input`, but only accepts numeric input.

The field uses third party library `react-number-format` for formatting field value.

## Best practices

`NumberInput` should be used for actual number values, such as counts and measures.

Do not use it for other digit-based values, such as telephone, credit card, and social security numbers.

When applicable, set the most common choice as the default value. For example, airline, bus, train and other travel companies typically default the number of passengers to 1.

## **Recommended for optimal usage**:

- Intl Provider (details [here](/docs/component-library-intl-intl--basic))

## Usage alongside IntlProvider

When rendering this component with `IntlProvider` as its wrapper in the component tree, the format will be
automatically inferred from the `locale` prop of `IntlProvider`.

## Usage without IntlProvider

If you wish to use this component without `IntlProvider`, you can do so by passing `thousandSeparator` and `decimalSeparator` props
to the component. This way, the format will be inferred from these props instead of the `locale` prop of `IntlProvider`.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Number Input Props:

<ArgsTable of={NumberInput} />
