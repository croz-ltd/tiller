# Radio Group

A `RadioGroup` is a form element that lets users select a single choice from a list of at least two options. The user can only select one radio option at a time.

Radio groups should:

- Include at least two or more options.
- Allow users to select only one option.
- Include at most 6 options. If there's a chance the Radio might later expand to include more than 6 options, use a Select instead.
- List options in a rational order that makes logical sense.

## Best practices

- Avoid nesting radio buttons within other radio buttons.
- If an option is strongly recommended, add `(Recommended)` to the label. Be sure to add it to the label, not the help text.
- Use the same name attribute on all radio buttons in the group. This ensures that if there is more than one group in the form, each one stays associated with its own group.
- If a radio group is “Optional”, users won't be able to unselect a selected radio. If you need to give users a way to unselect, consider using another type of form field.
