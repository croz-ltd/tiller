# Input

Input fields let users enter and edit text.

The `Input` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input, and optional information such as: placeholder, help text, leading icon, trailing icon, addon and number.

Standard form attributes are supported e.g. `required, disabled`, etc. as well as a `help` prop which is used to give context about a field's input, such as how the input will be used.

(for integration with Formik see docs [here](/docs/component-library-formik-elements-inputfield--with-label))
