# Input

Input fields let users enter and edit text.

The `Input` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input, and optional information such as: placeholder, help text, leading icon, trailing icon, addon and number.

Standard form attributes are supported e.g. `required, disabled`, etc. as well as a `help` prop which is used to give context about a field's input, such as how the input will be used.

(for integration with Formik see docs [here](/docs/component-library-formik-elements-inputfield--with-label))

## Input with clear button

The optional `allowClear` prop clears the fieldâ€™s current value.

It is hidden while the field is empty. Clear buttons are useful for search and filter fields,

where it is common for the user to want to clear the field value. However, in data entry forms, they are typically unnecessary.
