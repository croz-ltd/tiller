# Masked Input

A `MaskedInput` is an enhanced input field that improves readability by providing visual and non-visual cues to a user about the expected value.

User wonâ€™t be able to enter anything that does not match the mask.

Passing a `mask` prop into the `MaskedInput` component with a valid value will enable formatting to occur when the field is blurred.

Here's an example of the `mask` prop used in Stories below.

```ts
const mask = ["(", /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ")", " ", /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, "-", /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/];
```

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Masked Input Props:

<ArgsTable of={MaskedInput} />
