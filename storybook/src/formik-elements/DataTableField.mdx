# Data Table Field

The `DataTableField` component represents a data table with editing and/or adding capabilities for easier data modification.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `DataTable` by having an integrated logic for functions which
`DataTable` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

Props are described in detail on the [DataTableField Props section](#data-table-field-props) of the documentation.

## Used Types

```ts
type Item = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  surname: string;
};
```

## Used Props

```ts
const names = ["Emily", "Michael", "Sarah", "Matthew"];
const surname = ["Moore", "Williams", "Brown", "Davis"];

const allData: Item[] = range(0, 3).map((value) => ({
  id: value + 1,
  name: names[value % names.length],
  surname: surname[value % surname.length],
  age: (12 + value * 13) % 50,
}));

const InlineEditValidationSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  name: Yup.string().required("Name is required"),
  surname: Yup.string().required("Surname is required"),
});
```

## Used Hooks

```ts
const [dataTableState, dataTableHook] = useDataTable();
const [dataTableFieldState, dataTableFieldHook] = useDataTableField<Item[]>("customers");
```

Props inferred from **dataTableFieldHook** (see props docs for more info):
 - setNewRowFieldName
 - onNewRowSubmit
 - onNewRowReset
 - onRowEdit
 - onEditingRow
 - onRowEditCancel
 - onRowEditField
 - onRowEditSave
 - onRowDelete

Props inferred from **dataTableFieldState** (see props docs for more info):
 - data
 - rowEditingIndex
 - saveEnabled

## Usage

#### If you want to create a data table with **only adding** capabilities, follow these steps:

**1)** Define your field hook using `useDataTableField('desiredFieldName', ArbitraryValidationSchema)`.

**2)** For adding a new item to the table, wrap your desired inputs inside `DataTableField.NewRow`.
  - Each of the inputs should be hooked to the `dataTableFieldHook` (inferred from `useDataTableField`) and
    given a following name: `dataTableFieldHook.setNewRowFieldName('desiredName')`.
  - The button for adding an item should have a `dataTableFieldHook.onNewRowSubmit` function defined as an _onClick_ event.
  - The button for resetting values inside the fields should have a `dataTableFieldHook.onNewRowReset` function defined as an _onClick_ event.

**3)** Define your `DataTable`:
  - pass your `dataTableFieldState.data` as your _data_ prop
  - pass your`dataTableFieldState.rowEditingIndex` as your _rowEditingIndex_ prop

**Best examples** of these usages are represented in the following stories:
  - [With New Row](#with-new-row)
  - [With New Row And Initial Values](#with-new-row-and-initial-values)

<br />

#### If you want to create a data table with **only editing** capabilities, follow these steps:

**1)** Define your field hook using `useDataTableField('desiredFieldName', ArbitraryValidationSchema)`.

**2)** Define your `DataTable`:
  - pass your `dataTableFieldState.data` as your _data_ prop.
  - pass your`dataTableFieldState.rowEditingIndex` as your _rowEditingIndex_ prop.
  - pass your`dataTableFieldState.saveEnabled` as your _saveEnabled_ prop
    (which enables you to disable your arbitrary save button according to this value).

**3)** Define your `DataTable.Column` for editing actions and pass the following as children:
```ts
{(item: Item, index, row, { isEditMode }, saveEnabled) =>
  isEditMode ? (
    <div className="flex space-x-2">
      <IconButton
       icon={<Icon type="x" className="text-gray-500" />}
       label="Cancel"
       onClick={dataTableFieldHook.onRowEditCancel}
       />
      <IconButton
        icon={<Icon type="check" className="text-gray-500" />}
        label="Save"
        onClick={() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowEditSave(index)}
        disabled={!saveEnabled}
        />
    </div>
  ) : (
    <div className="flex space-x-2">
      <IconButton
         icon={<Icon type="pencil-simple" variant="fill" className="text-gray-500" />}
         label="Edit"
         onClick={() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowEdit(index)}
         />
      <IconButton
        icon={<Icon type="trash" variant="fill" className="text-gray-500" />}
        label="Delete"
        onClick={() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowDelete(index)}
        />
    </div>
  )
}
```

 - This is only an example of the usage, above components are most commonly used for such actions, but
   you can define others as well.
 - **Important:**
      - For the _cancel_ button, pass the `() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowEditCancel()` function as an _onClick_ event.
      - For the _save_ button, pass the `() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowEditSave(index)` function as an _onClick_ event.
      - For the _edit_ button, pass the `() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowEdit(index)` function as an _onClick_ event.
      - For the _delete_ button, pass the `() => dataTableFieldHook.onRowDelete(index)` function as an _onClick_ event.
      - If you wish to disable the save button according to the validation, pass the _!saveEnabled_ prop as the _disabled_ prop of the save button.

**4)** Define your `DataTable.Column`, which contain inputs and pass the following as children (for each column):
```ts
{(item: Item, index: number, row, { isEditMode }) =>
  isEditMode ? (
    <>
      <InputField
        name={dataTableFieldHook.onRowEditField(index, "name")}
        onFocus={() => dataTableFieldHook.onEditingRow("name")}
      />
    </>
  ) : (
    item.name || ""
  )
}
```

 - This is only an example of the usage, above components are most commonly used for such actions, but
   you can define others as well.
 - **Important:**
      - For the _name_ prop of the field, pass the `dataTableField.onRowEditField(index, fieldName)`.
      - If you wish to disable the save button according to the validation and retain the focus on your field
        when validation triggers, pass the `() => dataTableFieldHook.onEditingRow(fieldName)` function as an _onFocus_ event of the field.

**Best example** of this usage is represented in the following story:
  - [With Inline Edit](#with-inline-edit) - with validation when clicking the save button
  - [With Inline Edit And Instant Validation](#with-inline-edit-and-instant-validation) - with instant validation and conditional disabling of the save button

#### If you want to create a data table with **adding and editing** capabilities, combine the above-mentioned steps.

**Best example** of this usage is represented in the following story:
  - [With New Row And Inline Edit](#with-new-row-and-inline-edit)
