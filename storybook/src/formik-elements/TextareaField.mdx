# Textarea Field

A `TextareaField` lets users enter long form text which spans over multiple lines.

TextArea is typically used for descriptions, comments, and other longer free-form content.

You must `label` textareas. `Placeholder` text is **not** a suitable substitute for a label, as it disappears when users click inside the textarea.

Use `textareaClassname` prop to provide className for the textarea container.

Standard form attributes are supported e.g. `required`, `disabled`, etc.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `Textarea` by having an integrated logic for `onChange`, `onBlur` and `onReset`
functions which `Textarea` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

## When not to use:

Users can find open-ended questions difficult to answer.

It might be better to break up one complex question into a series of simple ones,

for example where users can select from options using radios.

Do not use the textarea component if you need to let users enter shorter answers no longer than a single line, such as a phone number or name.

In this case, you should use the `Input` component.
