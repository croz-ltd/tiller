# SelectField

`SelectField` allows users to choose one or more items from the list offered by the component. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

The component has various props intended to make improve ease of use as much as possible.

Props are described in detail on the [SelectField Props section](#selectfield-props)
of the documentation.

You can customize the `SelectField` component in the [SelectField Factory](#select-field-factory).

## Usage

- Use `SelectField` in a form as a way to allow the user to choose option(s) s from the dropdown.

- You may wish to review the general forms documentation about designing forms.

## Accessibility

 - Ensure that your color/contrast ratios and typography are accessible.

 - All form inputs should have a related, unique label that either wraps it, or precedes it. The label for attribute should match its inputâ€™s id element, regardless of whether it wraps the element or not.

 - If you have required inputs, use JavaScript to visually and physically align validation messages with labels for certain input fields

## Best Practices

We recommend using [Autocomplete Field](/docs/component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-label) over this component in most cases.
Use this component when:
 - it doesn't make sense for the user to have the ability to enter text alongside selecting items (ex. specific selection with few options)
 - you want to pass a more complex component (such as `Intl`) to show options (`AutocompleteField` cannot show values fetched by `Intl` component)


## Select Field Factory

The `Select Field Factory` story is used to easily visualize your select field, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Select Field component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Select Field component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Select Field Factory` story
of the Select Field.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Select Field.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Select Field, the code of the Select Field will be generated.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-selectfield--select-field-factory" />
</Canvas>
