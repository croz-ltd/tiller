# Masked Input Field

Masked input field is used to create an input component which masks your entered content in a
wrapper defined by your arbitrary mask.

It is particularly useful to, for example, show phone numbers in a more visually pleasing way.

Here's an example of the `mask` used in Stories below.

```ts
const mask = ["(", /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ")", /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, "-", /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/];
```

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Masked Input Field Props:

<ArgsTable of={MaskedInputField} />
