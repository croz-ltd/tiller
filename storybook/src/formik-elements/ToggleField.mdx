# Toggle Field

`ToggleField` is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states.

Toggles are only used for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips the switch”.

They are commonly used for “on/off” switches.

Use `labels` with a toggle so the action is clear. Labels should be three words or less and appear on the side of a toggle.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `Toggle` by having an integrated logic for `onClick`, `checked`
functions which `Toggle` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.
