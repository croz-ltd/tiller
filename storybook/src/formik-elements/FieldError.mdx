# Field Error

The `FieldError` component allows you to render an error message for a given field.

This is a **field** component, which means it has a provided logic for seamless
wrapping of the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

The component is attached to the Formik context and renders the error message according to the validation for set name.

By defining a name prop on the `FieldError` component, it will automatically render the error message for the field
with the aforementioned name when there is supposed to be one.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## FieldError Props:

<ArgsTable of={FieldError} />

## FieldError Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="FieldError"/>
