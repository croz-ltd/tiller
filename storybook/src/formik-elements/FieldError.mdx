# Field Error

The `FieldError` component allows you to render an error message for a given field.

By defining a name prop on the `FieldError` component, it will automatically render the error message for the field
with the aforementioned name when there is supposed to be one.

The component is particularly useful if you run into issues with displaying the error message for a field
and need to debug that field.

This is a **field** component, which means it has a provided logic for seamless
wrapping of the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

## FieldError Props:

<ArgsTable of={FieldError} />

## FieldError Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="FieldError"/>
