# Upload Button Field

Upload Button is the second approach for handling file uploads in Tiller. It works similar to `<input type="file />`
as it's a simple button that opens file explorer. Functionality is mostly the same as the `DragZone` component, so
if you need more info about logic behind file upload, check that docs.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `UploadButton` by having an integrated logic for hooks you pass to the component
and field props it inherits through Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik and pass it a hook for easier form creation.

The `singleFileUpload` property is a boolean attribute that can be used with the UploadButtonField. When set to true, it enforces
the behavior of allowing only a single file to be uploaded at a time. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want
to ensure that only a single file is associated with a specific field or action.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Upload Button Field Props:

`UploadButtonField` component has one unique prop:
 - `name` (_string_): the accessor value for the field component (for validation, fetching, etc.).

Other props are inferred from the `UploadButton` component and are displayed below:

## Upload Button Props:

<ArgsTable of={UploadButton} />

## Upload Button Tokens:

Upload button has no specific tokens, as it uses `Button` component for it's rendering.
