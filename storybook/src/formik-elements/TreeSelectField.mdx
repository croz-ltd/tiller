# Tree Select Field

The `TreeSelectField` component allows users to choose an option from a set of options (displayed in a hierarchy)
offered by the component. The component typically appears in forms and dialogs.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `TreeSelect` by having an integrated logic for `onChange`
functions which `TreeSelect` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

Props are described in detail on the [Tree Select Props section](#tree-select-props)
of the documentation.

Due to the nature of Storybook and its code display, some props in the code below are empty arrow functions.
In order to eliminate too long code displays and undefined functions, we've included these props in the display below.
Copy the props according to the usage of the code you're viewing.
