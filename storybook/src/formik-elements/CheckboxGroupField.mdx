This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `CheckboxGroup` by having an integrated logic for functions which
`CheckboxGroup` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

without having to manually add the title and group the checkboxes.

- Ensure that the `vertical` prop is used on mobile displays if your checkbox group contains a lot of items to avoid
overflowing.

**except**:
 - `value` - inferred from field name
 - `onChange` - handled by Formik

<ThemeTokens component="CheckboxGroup"/>
