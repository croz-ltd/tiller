# Autocomplete Field

`AutocompleteField` allows users to choose option(s) from set of options offered by the component with the possibility of
typing in the field.
The component typically appears in forms and dialogs.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `Autocomplete` by having an integrated logic for `onChange`, `onBlur` and `onReset`
functions which `Autocomplete` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

Props are described on the [AutocompleteField Props section](#autocompletefield-props)
of the documentation.

## Autocomplete Field Factory

The `Autocomplete Field Factory` story is used to easily visualize your autocomplete field, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Autocomplete Field component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Autocomplete Field component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Autocomplete Field Factory` story
  of the Autocomplete Field.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
  navigated to your created Autocomplete Field.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Autocomplete Field, the code of the Autocomplete Field will be generated.

## Important Note

Due to the nature of Storybook and its code display, some props in the code below are empty arrow functions.
In order to eliminate too long code displays and undefined functions, we've included these props in the display below.
Copy the props according to the usage of the code you're viewing.

## Used Types

```ts
export type Item = {
  username: string;
  name: string;
  surname: string;
};
```

## Used Props

```ts
const commonProps = {
  name: "test",
  itemToString: (item: Item) => `${item.name} ${item.surname}`,
  sort: (items: Item[]) => items.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name)),
};
```

```ts
const commonSimpleProps = {
  name: "test",
  itemToString: (item: string) => `${item}`,
  sort: (items: string[]) => items.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b)),
};
```

const complexProps = {
  name: "test",
  getOptionLabel: (item: Item) => (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap">
      <div>
        {item.name} {item.surname}
      </div>
      <div className="flex-shrink-0 text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500">@{item.username}</div>

                item.name
                  .concat(" " + item.surname)
                  .toLowerCase()
                  .indexOf(query.toLowerCase()) !== -1,
            )

</Canvas>

## With Error

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-error" />
</Canvas>

## With Complex Display

You can pass a complex (non-string) value as a `getOptionLabel` prop. That way, you can customize
the display of an item in the dropdown. Note: the display determined by `getOptionLabel` prop is only shown when an item is
in the dropdown and unchecked. Once the item is selected, the value displayed in the field is
determined by `itemToString` prop if `allowMultiple` is disabled or by `getMultipleSelectedLabel` prop if
`allowMultiple` is enabled.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-complex-display" />
</Canvas>

## With Multiple Selection

Multiple selection is possible by enabling the `allowMultiple` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-multiple-selection" />
</Canvas>

## With Multiple Selection And Values

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-multiple-selection-and-values" />
</Canvas>

## With Multiple Selection And Visible Labels

By passing a function as `getMultipleSelectedLabel` prop you can enable a custom display of selected items
inside the field instead of a counter shown by default.
(more info on the prop is in the [props](/docs/component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--autocomplete-field-factory#autocompletefield-props) section).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-multiple-selection-and-visible-labels" />
</Canvas>

## With Filtering on Frontend

If you enable filtering on the frontend you will experience **faster responses without loading animations** because
the component won't fetch from backend every time the input value changes.
But, depending on the dataset, this may not be what you want sometimes.

This way, you're handing an array of data to the component instead of an async fetch (via `options` prop),
but it's important to define the filtering method on the frontend with the `filter` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-filtering-on-frontend" />
</Canvas>

## With Tags

By enabling the `tags` prop, the look and feel of autocomplete field changes in order to accompany the display of selected
items as tags below the field. This gives you the ability to visualize selected items more explicitly and easily remove
selected tags or add new tags. <br />
It is recommended to use this variant with non-complex types (strings), but the usage with complex types is also possible.
**Note**: `tags` prop requires `allowMultiple` prop to also be enabled in order to function.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-tags" />
</Canvas>

You can also use complex values for tags, but be careful because this is a bit more complicated to implement due to the nature of objects.
Make sure you secure your _getCustomItem_ and _onAddCustomItem_ functions if you wish to have this option enabled when using complex types.
The example below represents the secured usage of this function, no matter the input value.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-complex-tags" />
</Canvas>

## With Contained Tags

Another variant for displaying tags is achieved by turning on the `tagsContained` prop. By doing this, the look and feel
of the component changes to a more contained one as tags are put inside the field itself.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-contained-tags" />
</Canvas>

## With Complex Tags

You can also pass complex objects as tags, there's no restriction to simple types. The _getCustomItem_ and _onAddCustomItem_ props
take care of how your newly added props will be saved.
See the description of these props in the [AutocompleteField Props section](#autocompletefield-props)
of the documentation for best explanation of their usage.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-complex-tags" />
</Canvas>

## With Adding Custom Tags

If you want to enable adding custom tags, the _getCustomItem_ and _onAddCustomItem_ props
take care of how your newly added props will be saved.
See the description of these props in the [AutocompleteField Props section](#autocompletefield-props)
of the documentation for best explanation of their usage.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-adding-custom-tags" />
</Canvas>

## **(NEW) With Adding Custom Items**

Using _getCustomItem_ prop you can enable the ability to check/select a newly added custom item.
However, if you wish to persist the item inside the component even if it's unselected, you need to use the
_onAddCustomItem_ prop alongside the _getCustomItem_ prop. Check the prop docs for more info.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-adding-custom-items" />
</Canvas>

## With Misused Props

If you, for example, do the following:

- fetch an array from backend, but don't enable the `allowMultiple` prop or vice versa,
- pass an array instead of an async promise (decide to do full frontend fetch and filtering), but don't pass the `filter` prop <br />
  ...the component automatically becomes disabled and notifies you to adjust the props accordingly.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-autocompletefield--with-misused-props" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

- Use `AutocompleteField` in a form as a way to allow the user to enter a value associated with a key, such as entering their name in a field labeled name
  and choosing from the list of available options.

- You may wish to review the general forms documentation about designing forms.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that your color/contrast ratios and typography are accessible.

- All form inputs should have a related, unique label that either wraps it, or precedes it. The label for attribute should match its input’s id element, regardless of whether it wraps the element or not.

- **Tip**: don't show too much info, some props like maxItems are optional for a reason, and the default value exists because
  it represents an optimal UX design.

## Best Practices

- Use the sort prop to sort items, it is much easier for a user to find the item if the items are sorted
- **Prefer Autocomplete Field over Select Field in most cases**, it gives the same features with the extra ability to search
- If you want to truly have a Select Field experience on Autocomplete Field (all options listed), set the `maxItems` prop to
  the length of your items array
- If the size of your dataset is not large or you want a seamless experience, you may want to enable **filtering on frontend**
  for faster visual response without loading animations
- Make sure to follow up with your validation (be it on frontend on backend) if you enable `required` prop, because the prop only
  visually defines the field as required
