# Time Input Field

Time Input allow users to enter a specific time value. They can be used for a wide range of scenarios.

Common use cases include:
- Setting an alarm
- Scheduling a meeting

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `TimeInputField` by having an integrated logic for `onChange`, `onBlur` and `onReset`
functions which `TimeInput` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />
