# InputField

`InputField` allows users to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `Input` by having a provided logic for seamless
wrapping of the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

Props are described on the [InputField Props section](#inputfield-props)
of the documentation.

You can customize the `InputField` component in the [InputField Factory](#input-field-factory).

## Usage

- Use `InputField` in a form as a way to allow the user to enter a value associated with a key, such as entering their name in a field labeled name.

- You may wish to review the general forms documentation about designing forms.

## Accessibility

Ensure that your color/contrast ratios and typography are accessible.

All form inputs should have a related, unique label that either wraps it, or precedes it. The label for attribute should match its inputâ€™s id element, regardless of whether it wraps the element or not.

Try to give all inputs a type='' attribute (types include email, tel, text, submit, etc.). When supported by a browser, they improve the experience of all users.

If you have required inputs, use JavaScript to visually and physically align validation messages with labels for certain input fields

## Input Field Factory

The `Input Field Factory` story is used to easily visualize your input field, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Input Field component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Input Field component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Input Field Factory` story
of the Input Field.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Input Field.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Input Field, the code of the Input Field will be generated.
