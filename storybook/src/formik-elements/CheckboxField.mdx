# Checkbox Field

The `CheckboxField` component is used when there is an option or list of options and the user may select any number of choices, including zero. <br />

This is a **field** component, which means it is differs from `Checkbox` by having an integrated logic for functions which
`Checkbox` possesses using Formik. There is no need for any custom logic, just wrap the component inside Formik for easier form creation.

The component can be used with or without the label and has a customizable look through props.

Props are described in detail on the [CheckboxField Props section](#checkbox-field-props) of the documentation.

You can customize the `CheckboxField` component in the [CheckboxField Factory](/story/component-library-formik-elements-checkboxfield--checkbox-field-factory).

## Usage

Primarily for use in forms, checkboxes are used to collect input from users. Users can select a number of options ranging from zero to multiple options.

Use `CheckboxField` when:

- users have to select one or more options from a list of related items
- an explicit action is required to apply settings

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the checkbox can be reached and interacted with by both keyboard controls and clicks.

- Keep the aria-checked attribute up to date following user interactions.

- Provide styles that indicate when the checkbox has focus.

## Checkbox Field Factory

The `Checkbox Field Factory` story is used to easily visualize your checkbox field, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Checkbox Field component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Checkbox Field component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Checkbox Field Factory` story
of the Checkbox Field.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Checkbox Field.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Checkbox Field, the code of the Checkbox Field will be generated.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-formik-elements-checkboxfield--checkbox-field-factory" />
</Canvas>
