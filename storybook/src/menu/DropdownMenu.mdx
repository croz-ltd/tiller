# Dropdown Menu

The `DropdownMenu` component is a component which triggers a dropdown menu when clicked on and features a
host of customizability features to create a dropdown menu of your liking.

All props are described in detail on the [Dropdown Menu Props](#dropdown-menu-props) section of the documentation.

## Dropdown Menu Factory

The `Dropdown Menu Factory` story is used to easily visualize your dropdown menu, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Dropdown Menu component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Dropdown Menu component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Dropdown Menu Factory` story
of the Dropdown Menu.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Dropdown Menu.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Dropdown Menu, the code of the Dropdown Menu will be generated.

**Limitations:**
 - Due to Storybook's limitations, the shown code will not be functional **unless you replace the following**:
    - `DropdownMenuItem ` -> `DropdownMenu.Item `

### Result:

  <Story id="component-library-menu-dropdownmenu--dropdown-menu-factory" />
