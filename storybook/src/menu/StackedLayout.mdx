# Stacked Layout

`Stacked Layout` gives you a complete template for your website, featuring a top navigation and a content section.

The best possible documentation for this component would be the [Props documentation](#stacked-layout-props)
and the code of the stories listed below.

## Stacked Layout Factory

The `Stacked Layout Factory` story is used to easily visualize your Stacked Layout, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Stacked Layout component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Stacked Layout component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Stacked Layout Factory` story
of the Stacked Layout.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Stacked Layout.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Stacked Layout, the code of the Stacked Layout will be generated.
