import { ArgsTable, Stories } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

import { Date } from "@tiller-ds/date";

# Date

The `Date` component converts the _children_ to a formatted date.

## **Recommended for optimal usage**:

- Intl Provider (details [here](/docs/component-library-intl-intl--basic))

## Usage alongside IntlProvider

The component uses `FormattedDate` from `react-intl` library and converts children to
a format inferred by locale.

## Usage without IntlProvider

If you wish to use this component without `IntlProvider`, you can do so by passing the `format` prop
to the component. This way, the format will be inferred from this prop instead of the `locale` prop of `IntlProvider`.

### Important Note

Be careful when importing the component because it shares the name with **React's Date interface**.
Consider importing it the following way to avoid it being mistaken by the Date interface:

```tsx
import { Date as TillerDate } from "@tiller-ds/date";
```

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Date Props:

<ArgsTable of={Date} />
