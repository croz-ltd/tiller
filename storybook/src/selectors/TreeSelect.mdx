# Tree Select

The `TreeSelect` component allows users to choose an option from a set of options (displayed in a hierarchy)
offered by the component. The component typically appears in forms and dialogs.

This is a **non-field** component, which means it is differs from `TreeSelectField` by lacking logic for seamless
state changing. The custom usage of `onChange`, `onBlur` and `onReset` props is required.

Props are described in detail on the [Tree Select Props section](#tree-select-props)
of the documentation.

## **Prerequisites for functioning**:
 - Intl Provider (details [here](/docs/component-library-intl-intl--basic))

## Important Note

Due to the nature of Storybook and its code display, some props in the code below are empty arrow functions.
In order to eliminate too long code displays and undefined functions, we've included these props in the display below.
Copy the props according to the usage of the code you're viewing.

## Used Types

```ts
export type TreeItem = {
  name: string;
  code?: string;
  items?: TreeItem[];
};
```

## Used Props

```ts
const commonProps = {
  name,
  onChange,
  onBlur,
  options: treeItems,
  // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name

  getItems: (option: TreeItem) => option.items || [],
};
```
