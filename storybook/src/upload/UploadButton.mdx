# Upload Button

Upload Button is the second approach for handling file uploads in Tiller. It works similar to `<input type="file />`
as it's a simple button that opens file explorer. Functionality is mostly the same as the `DragZone` component, so
if you need more info about logic behind file upload, check that docs.

<Stories includePrimary={true} />

## Upload Button Props:

<ArgsTable of={UploadButton} />

## Upload Button Tokens:

Upload button has no specific tokens, as it uses `Button` component for it's rendering.
