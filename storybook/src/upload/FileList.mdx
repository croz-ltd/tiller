# File List

`FileList` Component goes hand in hand with `DragZone` or `UploadButton`, dependent of which one you use in your app.
It serves as a simple list that show currently uploaded files, and provides helper actions to manage them.

Basic usage is like this:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-upload-file-list--simple" />
</Canvas>

You can also have actions on the `FileList`:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="component-library-upload-file-list--with-actions" />
</Canvas>

Note that calling `helpers.deleteFile` only deletes file from the frontend list. If you want to remove it on the
backend, you need to call appropriate endpoint yourself.

## File List Props:
