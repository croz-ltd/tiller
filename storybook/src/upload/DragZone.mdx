# Drag Zone

`DragZone` component is one of the two approaches Tiller provides for handling file upload. DragZone serves mainly as a
drag and drop window for the file upload. It could be used inside forms, but also on its own (for example details
page).

Under the hood, it uses [react-uploady](https://github.com/rpldy/react-uploady) for handling the file upload
logic. For more advanced file upload customizations also check their documentation.

To use `DragZone` in a component, you must also have a call to `useFileUpload` hook, so it can track which files are
currently in the file list. `useFileUpload` hook also provides a list of the uploaded files which can be used in
`FileList` Component, or in your custom implementation of the uploaded file list.

## **Prerequisites for functioning**:
 - Intl Provider (details [here](/docs/component-library-intl-intl--basic))

Basic example looks something like this:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="component-library-upload-dragzone--simple"/>
</Canvas>

*Note that you usually do not need to provide `send` parameter. Here the mock version is used for storybook
    purposes only.*

`DragZone` also allows multiple file upload at the same time with the `allowMultiple` prop:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="component-library-upload-dragzone--with-multiple-files"/>
</Canvas>

`DragZone` is commonly used with the `FileList` component, which renders current file list in a simple table.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="component-library-upload-dragzone--and-file-list"/>
</Canvas>

If you want to have a file upload inside a form which already uses Formik, see `DragZoneField`.

## useFileUpload details

`useFileUpload` is used as an actual logic what is currently in the file list. It can be initialized with the file
list previously fetched from the backend.

It can be used in two ways:
1. as a controlled file list where you must manually update which files are currently uploaded
2. as an uncontrolled file list where you specify default update handler and do not think about anything else

In both cases, you need to provide callback logic for the file upload event.

For the first case, you will have something like this:

```tsx
function MyUploadComponent() {
  const fileUploadHookValue = useFileUpload();
  const [uploadedFileIds, setUploadedFileIds] = React.useState<string[]>([]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fileUploadHookValue.onUpdateCallback((added, removed) => {
      setUploadedFileIds(oldFileIds => {
        let newFileIds = [...oldFileIds];
        if (added !== undefined) {
          newFileIds.push(added);
        }
        if (removed !== undefined) {
          newFileIds = newFileIds.filter(id => id !== removed);
        }
        // update internal file id list with correct updated list
        fileUploadHookValue.onUploadedFileIds(newFileIds);
        return newFileIds;
      });
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <DragZone
      title="Upload files"
      url="/api/upload-file"
      hook={fileUploadHookValue}
    />
  );
}
```

This is a bit tedious, so if you do not have a valid reason to store a list yourself, you can use it like this:

```tsx
function MyShorterUploadComponent() {
  const fileUploadHookValue = useFileUpload([], true);

  return (
    <DragZone
      title="Upload files"
      url="/api/upload-file"
      hook={fileUploadHookValue}
    />
  );
}
```

If you need the values of the current file list (and you will need that if you want to show to user what he/she has
uploaded), you can use `fileUploadHookValue.uploadedFiles`.

## Details about upload to backend

Tiller implementation of the file upload expects certain backend behaviour to function properly.
Backend call for file upload will be called immediately when user drops a file in the `DragZone`.
Backend should save the file and return an object which returns at least an id which Tiller can use to differentiate
uploaded files. If the response from the backend cannot be changed, `mapUploadResponse` can be used to adjust the
difference. Also, by default, it uses XHR multipart request to send data to the backend.

In case you need to send additional parameters for the backend call, check `destinationOptions` param which allows
sending headers, http method, request parameters and files parameter name.

If you want to have different behaviour (maybe saving all the files together with the form, or sending files to
backend with JSON and base64) you must provide custom `send` method which will handle that specific logic.

By default, `useFileUpload` works with Tiller's `File` type which provides basic info about the uploaded file.
If your backend saves more information, you can extend the `File` type with your custom information:

```tsx
type Document = {
   size: number;
   uploadDate: string;
   fileType: FileType;
   author: string;
} & File;

function MyBetterUploaderComponent() {
  const fileUploadHookValue = useFileUpload<Document>([], true);

  return (
    <>
      <DragZone
        title="Upload files"
        url="/api/upload-file-but-better"
        hook={fileUploadHookValue}
      />
      <div>
        {fileUploadHookValue.uploadedFiles.map(doc => (
          <p>{doc.name}, {doc.size}MB, author: {doc.author}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```
