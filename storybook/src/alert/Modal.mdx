# Modal

Modal dialogs interrupt users and demand an **action**. They are appropriate when user’s attention needs to be directed toward important information.

Import `useModal` hook also from `@tiller-ds/alert` module.

Here is code example of the `basic` modal:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-alert-modal--simple" />
</Canvas>

In case you need a modal `without an icon` you can use this:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-alert-modal--without-icon" />
</Canvas>

When modals become too long for the user’s viewport or device, they `scroll` independent of the page itself. Try the story below to see what we mean.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-alert-modal--with-scrollbar" />
</Canvas>

When action on modal opens another popup which needs to get focused, modal will keep focus and will not let for example input element to get focus.
In this case you should use `dangerouslyBypassFocusLock` prop.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="component-library-alert-modal--with-bypassed-focus-lock" />
</Canvas>

## Modal With State

`State` prop is used for fetching or storing the **state** of the modal.
It can store simple or complex types. The state stores a value given to the modal in the `onOpen function`.
For example, if you want to pass a `string` value to a modal `onOpen`, you would define the modal as
```const modal = useModal<string>()``` and open the modal with ```modal.onOpen('someString')```.

Code example of the modal `with state`:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-alert-modal--with-state" />
</Canvas>

Code example of the modal `with state render prop`:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-alert-modal--with-state-render-prop" />
</Canvas>

## Modal Props:

<ArgsTable of={Modal} />

## Modal Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="Modal"/>
