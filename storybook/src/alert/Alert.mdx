# Alert

An alert displays a short, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.

All props are described in detail on the [Alert Props](#alert-props) section of the documentation.

## Tabs Factory

The `Alert Factory` story is used to easily visualize your alerts, giving you the
ability to modify the look and make the Tabs component of your choice by
using **controls**.

To create your custom Tabs component:

- Switch to the `Canvas` section of the Storybook and navigate to `Alert Factory` story
of the Alert.
- Modify props using controls.
- When you're happy with what you've created, switch back to the `Docs` section, and you will be automatically
navigated to your created Alert.
- After you click the `Show code` button below your custom Alert, the code of the Alert will be generated.

### Result:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="component-library-alert-alert--alert-factory" />
</Canvas>

<Stories />

## Alert Props:

<ArgsTable of={Alert} />

## Alert Tokens:
<ThemeTokens component="Alert"/>
