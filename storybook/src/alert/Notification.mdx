# Notification

`Notification` component is used to display a notification on screen provided by the `NotificationProvider` component.

It serves as a heads-up information component displayed after executing various tasks, such as adding or editing an entity
when submitting a form.

The `title` is the only required prop to be passed onto the component.

All props are described on the [Notification Props section](/docs/component-library-alert-notification--with-actions-right#notification-props)
of the documentation.

## Best Practices

- Include the `icon` prop when displaying a notification, that way the notification is more visually
  attractive and noticeable
- Prefer using the `description` prop when handling complex operations to give the user more info on the
  details of the action
- As a rule, avoid disabling the `closeButton` prop because it gives the user more control over a notification by
  enabling him to close the notification and avoid distractions rather than waiting for the notification
  to disappear by itself

### **Important Notice:**

**For notifications to function properly, wrap your desired routes with a `NotificationProvider` component.**

Notification component is **not designed to be explicitly called** on your website.
It is meant to be called by assigning a **`useNotificationContext()`** function to a constant and displaying a
notification with **`.push`** method.

Find out more about the `NotificationProvider`, along with examples on
how to summon your notification [here](/docs/component-library-alert-notificationprovider--example).
